# TIE-50307 - Exercise 05 - Q&A

## 1. What is the goal of this exercise? What did you accomplish?

In this exercise we used the new bitstream file to apply calculating interrupt latency by reading the proper register. Furthermore, the bitstream can be generated using verilog.

## 2. Describe your verilog coding process in 2 paragraphs

## 3. How much difference there is in latency between the regular driver build and the debug driver build? Why?

The latency of debugging build is significantly higher than the regular one

## 4. How can you find the base address for the IP block register space in Vivado? Does it match the contents of the devicetree?

## 5. Feedback (what was difficult? what was easy? how would you improve it?)
This exercise is easy, without the verilog part.
